# HeterogeneityMASEM
Abstract: Meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) has gained attention from researchers because it is increasingly recognized as a way to build and test theories. However, challenges remain as to how we can model and explain meaningful heterogeneity in structural equation modeling (SEM) parameters in the presence of missing values. Recently, two novel methods have been proposed to tackle this issue: Bayesian MASEM (BMASEM) and one-stage MASEM (OSMASEM). Yet, controversy and confusions exist over how the two methods can be applied to solve psychological research questions with real data involving heterogeneity. In this study, we describe and compare the two methods, , with two examples involving real data to test a mediation model and a confirmatory factor analysis model. In the illustrations, both methods were used to test the moderating effect of a covariate, to build a prediction equation for effect sizes in specific populations, and to evaluate the metric invariance of a scale. The study ends with a discussion on practical issues that may arise when applying BMASEM and OSMASEM. Detailed and annotated scripts and outputs for all analyses are provided.
